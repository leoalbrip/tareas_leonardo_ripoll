            <p class="sangria">The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire<br>
                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,<br>
                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from<br>
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey<br>
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.<br><br><br>

                    minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will<br>
                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board<br>
                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams<br>
                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable<br>
                    field may be required to play all their games away.<br><br>
